<h3>A Beginner-Friendly Guide to Buying Bitcoin</h3>

<h3>Step 1: Set Up Your Coinbase Account</h3>
<p>To begin, visit the <a href="https://www.coinbase.com">Coinbase website</a> and sign up for an account. You'll need to provide personal information, such as your name, email address, and a secure password. After completing the initial registration, you’ll receive a verification email. Click the link in the email to verify your account.</p>
<p>Next, you’ll need to verify your identity. This process typically involves providing a government-issued ID, such as a passport or a driver's license. Coinbase uses this information to comply with regulatory requirements and enhance the security of your account.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Add a Payment Method</h3>
<p>Once your account is set up and verified, the next step is to add a payment method. In Switzerland, you can link your bank account or use a credit or debit card.
